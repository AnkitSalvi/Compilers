JAVA Lexer

We implemented a lexer which outputs lexemes.

The tuple for which we implement the lexer is
SOURCE LANGUAGE: JAVA
IMPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE: C++
TARGET LANGUAGE: x86

We wrote a scanner.y file which when compiled by using bison generated scanner.tab.c and scanner.tab.h.

The scanner.tab.h file is used in the scanner.cpp file after compiling scanner.l using Flex .Using scanner.cpp file we generated tokens.

Procedure to run the lexer:
Follow the below set of commands.

– cd asgn1
– make
– bin/lexer test/test1.c
